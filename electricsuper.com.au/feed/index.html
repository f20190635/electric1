										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are many reasons you might think about taking time away from work. It’s a big, wide world out there and there’s a lot to see and do.</p>
<p>You could be considering having children, taking time out to volunteer, taking a year off to write that novel you’ve always dreamt of, or perhaps you’re thinking about study or taking on caring responsibilities.</p>
<p>Whatever your reason for taking time away from work, don’t leave your super to fall behind while you are out exploring new experiences.</p>
<p>If you are 45, have $300,000 in super and earn $120,000 a year, taking a year off work without pay now (and without the corresponding contributions to your super) could mean you have over $19,000 less in your super by the time you reach 65.*</p>
<p>As you start planning time away from work, consider whether or not it might suit you to contribute a bit extra to super in the lead up to your work break. The sooner you start making additional payments into super, the longer that money has to compound and grow. Your super can be growing and expanding at the same time as you are out growing and expanding your life.</p>
<p>If you’re considering what a break from work might do to your super, try our <a href="http://www.supercalcs.com.au/ris9/mst/tutorial">online Super Calculator</a>. It’s a dynamic, interactive tool that lets you test different scenarios in the safety of an online calculator. See what happens if you contribute more or less, change salary, take a career break, retire earlier or later and so much more.</p>
<p>And, as always, if you need any help with the Retirement Planner or any aspect of your superannuation you can always call us on <a href="phone:1300307844">1300 307 844</a> or <a href="http://electricsuper.com.au/meet-with-us/">make an appointment</a> to meet with one of our Member Services Team. We can meet you at your workplace, at our offices in the Adelaide CBD or anywhere that suits you. <a href="http://electricsuper.com.au/meet-with-us/">Book a free appointment easily online</a>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Assumptions: That’s assuming your regular super guarantee from your employer is 9.5% ($11,400 a year) and you earn an average of 7% on your super investments until you reach age 65. Fees 1.41%, insurance premium $400, CPI 2.1%, improvement in living standards 1.1%</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It is easy to make money the focus of your retirement planning. Having your financial plans in place well in advance gives you a good understanding of the kind of lifestyle you can afford.</p>
<p>But money is just one aspect of stepping away from work. With good planning, your finances will hopefully be the least of your worries. As you get closer to hanging up your hi-vis, laptop or calculator for the last time, it’s worth thinking about the way you’re going to spend your time.</p>
<p>We’ve put together a few pointers to help get you started.</p>
<h3><strong>1. Who will be around?</strong></h3>
<p>Your vision of retirement might include anything from cycling to meet friends for coffee to spending every afternoon playing golf to sitting on the couch, catching up on your favourite Netflix shows while you learn to knit -all great past-times.</p>
<p>However, will your friends and relatives be available to join you? This is particularly important to think about if you are retiring before your spouse, or are one of the early retirees in your friendship group.</p>
<p>The reverse is also true. Your spouse might already have retired, or retire at the same time as you, and have a completely different idea of what you’ll do together. Make sure you talk to them about what they expect for your retirement together.</p>
<p>Also consider what other family members expect or hope your retirement will look like, especially as it relates to them. Talk to your children and other close relatives to set some boundaries about what you want for your retirement.</p>
<h3><strong>2. What are you going to do?</strong></h3>
<p>After a lifetime of working, the idea of sleeping in every day for the rest of your life can sound like bliss. Maybe you haven’t planned anything beyond “doing nothing”.</p>
<p>Doing nothing is actually a great way to spend time. You reap the rewards of a working life without guilt. Enjoy feeling the pressures of work lifting from your shoulders, savour the quiet of home, and rest.</p>
<p>Please believe us, though, that you’re likely to become a bit antsy after a while, rattling around with no purpose.</p>
<p>Before you retire, why not make a list of everything you would like to do and things you used to enjoy that you might get back to? Include big and small things. Want to learn to abseil? Put it down. Dining room need repainting? Add it to the list. Used to love camping? Scribble it down. Hoping to spend more time helping out with your local neighbourhood cricket team? Write it on there.</p>
<p>Don’t judge your list or put pressure on yourself to get everything done. It’s only a list of suggestions that you’re making for yourself in case you get stuck. You can add new things as they take your fancy and cross things off if you change your mind.</p>
<p>Set yourself a timeframe to stop ‘doing nothing’. When that deadline approaches, you can decide if you’re ready to leap into a new activity (or an old one!), and if you are, you’ve got a whole list of options to choose from right there at your fingertips. If you want a bit more ‘doing nothing’, reset your timeframe and check in again with yourself then.</p>
<h3><strong>3. Staying healthy</strong></h3>
<p>Everyone’s health is as unique as they are. Some people enjoy good health with no extra effort on their part; others can’t seem to catch a break.</p>
<p>Whatever your health is like now, make sure you factor your physical wellbeing as part of your life in retirement.</p>
<p>We’re not suggesting you start training for your first marathon (although, of course, if you want to, go for it!) but put some thought into your health. Health can include movement and exercise, eating well and seeking professional medical support and having health checks when they’re due.</p>
<p>It’s an old adage, but it’s true &#8211; all the money in the world can’t buy good health. Invest some effort into looking after your health.</p>
<h3><strong>4. And finally, what if you don’t want to retire?</strong></h3>
<p>Almost half of all Australians stop working because they have access to their superannuation or a pension. Not because they necessarily have a burning desire to stop.</p>
<p>If you like your work and enjoy the structure and social elements it provides you, or if you take your identity from what you do, the idea of walking away from that can be confronting and uncomfortable. Who will you be without your job? How will you cope without the structure or social contact? They’re real concerns and shouldn’t be diminished.</p>
<p>If this is you, recognise and acknowledge it. Consider what aspects of work you will miss most: Structure, socialising, mentoring younger staff, starting and finishing projects, being known as a “liney/accountant/storeman/etc”, or something else?</p>
<p>Think about what you can do in your new retired life that will provide you with the aspects you’ll miss.</p>
<p>If you enjoy mentoring and like the structure of work, for example, you could join the local volleyball team, where you can chat to the other players and provide them with the benefit of your life experience as you get to know them, as well as you enjoying the regularity of playing twice a week in a league fixture and meeting with your team to train once a week.</p>
<p>The solutions to your concerns are as individual as you are. It’s worth spending some time considering what it is you’ll miss about work and what you can do to address those things. Remember too, that if your first “solution” doesn’t work, you can rethink and try something else.</p>
<p>In addition to these concerns, many people are concerned about giving up the certainty of a regular wage to their bank account each fortnight. If that’s you, make an appointment to talk with us about the financial side of your retirement any time you like. We can help explain how super could work in retirement, including the different ways it can be converted into an ongoing income. Make a time to talk to us now to put your mind at ease.</p>
<h3><strong>Now get out there!</strong></h3>
<p>Having a good understanding of your finances is only one aspect of retirement. Give the social, physical, mental and emotional aspects of your life some thought and get out there and enjoy your new life!</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you’ve ever lodged an insurance claim for anything, you will know the importance of being adequately insured.</p>
<p>Ever had a bike stolen and discovered too late that your home and contents policy doesn’t cover items that are stolen “on the road”? Or, have you ever tried to claim for podiatry services, for example, only to find that your health cover isn’t up to the task and only covers the first $20?</p>
<p>Having insurance is great, but knowing you have <em>enough</em> insurance is better.</p>
<p>ElectricSuper accumulation members may have access to Death, Total and Permanent Disability Insurance and Income Protection (Disability Income Benefit) as part of their super.*</p>
<p>But have you looked at your own insurance needs lately? Do you know if what you are provided with matches what you actually need?</p>
<p>Let’s break it down.</p>
<h4><strong>Protecting your regular income</strong></h4>
<p>If you can’t work because of illness or injury, you may be eligible to claim Disability Income Benefit insurance through your super. If you’re eligible, this will provide you with a fortnightly income of up to two-thirds of your salary for up to 12 months.</p>
<p>As with all insurance, you need to find your balance between the level of risk you are prepared to take and the risk you want someone else (the insurer) to take for you. You might be comfortable with cover for two-thirds of your salary for up to 12 months. But, if two-thirds of your salary and/or up to 12 months feels like it might not be enough to you, you can seek an income protection provider outside of super which can offer you income protection cover for a different amount or percentage of salary for 2 years, 5 years, or even through until you reach retirement age.</p>
<p>You should also find out what benefits your employer offers, as our Participating Employers have different employee benefits available to their staff and they may provide you with a level of cover above the two-thirds of salary you can receive through your super.</p>
<p>And, of course, if you don’t have Disability Income Benefit insurance as part of your super, you will need to consider if you want or need income protection insurance and then seek a provider who will offer you the insurance you need for a reasonable price.</p>
<p>Equally, if you have Disability Income Benefit cover and don’t need or want it, you can <a href="http://www.electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238888_ETSAC_Adjusting-Insurance-Cover_V5.pdf">apply to cancel it</a>.</p>
<h4><strong>Protecting your family and yourself</strong></h4>
<p>The other kind of insurance you could have through your super with ElectricSuper is Death and Total and Permanent Disablement.</p>
<p>You need to consider these insurances separately.</p>
<h5>First, what happens if you die?</h5>
<p>1. If you die, will those you leave behind be able to cope financially without your ongoing salary and support?</p>
<p>This starts almost immediately with paying for a funeral, but will go on to include the costs of a mortgage or rent, paying bills and maintaining a household, which could include tasks around the house that you currently take care of at no cost.</p>
<p>For example, you might do 50% of the housework, stay home with the kids 2 nights a week while your partner goes to night classes, cook 5 nights a week and do small household tasks like repainting a spare room or installing an extra power point in the kitchen. What will the cost of you not being around to undertake these tasks actually be? Will your partner need to get a cleaner in? What about a babysitter? Will the cost of food increase if they get more pre-prepared meals? And how much to hire a painter or an electrician?</p>
<p>You also need to consider if covering those expenses is actually important to you. It may be that your spouse has other sources of income, or other ways to provide for themselves and the family. Or it might be that you and your partner are happy to take some of that risk and not insure for those kinds of things.</p>
<p>Or, you might not have a family to worry about in the first place. Or for any number of other reasons, having Death cover might not be a consideration for you at all.</p>
<p>You need to weigh up your personal needs for your situation.</p>
<h5>The second point to consider is if you are totally and permanently disabled.</h5>
<p>2. If you are totally and permanently disabled and can no longer work, will you be able to afford to make any required modifications to your home and car, as well as pay the regular bills (they just never stop)?</p>
<p>If your mobility changes as a result of your disablement, will you need to install ramps at home, widen doors or install other aids? Or modify the kitchen so you can reach everything, including the kitchen sink? Will you have to have the car modified to use your arms only, or only one foot? Or will you take taxis everywhere?</p>
<p>On top of these upfront changes, you may have ongoing medical costs as well as the usual costs of living, such as bills, school fees, meals out, haircuts and so on.</p>
<p>However, just as for Death cover, you need to consider your own situation and what you think you might need and the risk you are prepared to carry.</p>
<p>The Death and TPD insurance that you may have through your ElectricSuper are tied together, so it’s important to consider both of these 2 questions when you review your insurance in your super.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.moneysmart.gov.au/how-life-insurance-works/life-insurance-calculator">Australian Government’s MoneySmart website</a> has a great, easy-to-use calculator to help you work out your insurance needs. It’s quicker than you think. You can <a href="http://www.moneysmart.gov.au/how-life-insurance-works/life-insurance-calculator">find the calculator here</a>.</p>
<p>Once you have checked your insurance needs, review the insurance you have in your super. You can see what cover you have in the secure area of the website. If it’s not the right amount for you, you can apply to increase, decrease or cancel your cover. Find the forms to amend your cover here:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238888_ETSAC_Adjusting-Insurance-Cover_V5.pdf">Active Accumulation (Division 5) members</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238889_Adjusting-your-insurance-cover-retainedspouse_V3a.pdf">Retained (Division 5) members</a></li>
<li><a href="http://www.electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238889_Adjusting-your-insurance-cover-retainedspouse_V3a.pdf">Spouse members</a></li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>*Accumulation Scheme “active” members under 60 are automatically provided with cover on joining. Retained members may or may not have insurance automatically provided as part of their insurance, depending on their circumstances when moving to a Retained account. Spouse members have different conditions and do not automatically have Death and Total and Permanent Disability (TPD) cover. Spouse members aren’t eligible for Disability Income Benefit. You can read more about these two membership types and the insurance provided on our website. You can also see what insurance you have in your super in the <a href="http://www.secure.superfacts.com/customer/EISS/login?client_id=TsikUeoWS7G3pLxp2UAzQ3cyX8sRUaUg&amp;redirect_uri=https://www.youraccountonline.com/form/login.html&amp;scope=customers:website&amp;state=TUF4VHp1bFdDRmkyYmVvcy1FSVNT&amp;code_challenge=--aryjeeD0AiKEz-zGCo4SXRRrC2JkRMg1FBYIGsq8Q&amp;code_challenge_method=S256&amp;client_type=web">secure area of the website</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>There are exceptions, of course, but most people plan to retire eventually.</p>
<p>Some people have a particular age in mind. Others plan to leave work once they have a certain amount in super. For yet others, their retirement date will be once they’ve completed a particular project or piece of work, or once their partner is also ready to retire.<img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4652 alignleft" title="Retirement age graph" src="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Image-55.4-years-300x300.png" alt="Graph showing anticipated retirement age for men at 65.9 years and actual average retirement 59.5, and expected retirement for women at 65 years and actual retirement 52.1 years" width="525" height="525" srcset="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Image-55.4-years-300x300.png 300w, https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Image-55.4-years-150x150.png 150w, https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Image-55.4-years.png 600w" sizes="(max-width: 525px) 100vw, 525px" /></p>
<p>Whatever it is that you think will launch you into retirement, it’s worth considering the fact that a large proportion of people leave work long before they planned to.</p>
<p>In fact, the difference between the age the average person plans to leave work and the age that the average person actually does leave work is as much as 13 years earlier for women and 6 years for men.</p>
<p>That might sound confronting, but the good news is that just under half of retirees (46%) leave work because they are eligible to access their super. It means a great number of people are in a position where leaving paid employment earlier than planned is a positive choice, rather than something they are forced to do due to ill health or caring responsibilities.</p>
<p>It takes some planning and consideration to make sure your super is as ship-shape as it can be. Are you on track to get your super where you’d like it to be by the time you plan to retire? Or even earlier?</p>
<p>The earlier you retire, the longer you will spend in retirement so the longer your money will need to last.</p>
<p>Our <a href="http://www.supercalcs.com.au/ris9/mst">online calculator</a> is a great tool that lets you see how long your money could last once you’ve retired. It allows you to vary different factors, such as an earlier retirement date, to see what difference that will make to the longevity of your super. It can also help you see what extra contributions to your super now can do for your lifestyle in retirement. You can test what drawing a larger or smaller fortnightly income in retirement could look like for you. You can also include your spouse’s details and the calculator can incorporate the aged pension if you want to give you a complete picture of your money in retirement. <a href="http://www.supercalcs.com.au/ris9/mst">Give it a try now</a>.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The focus of this year&#8217;s Federal Budget (announced on 11 May 2021) is on initiatives designed to maintain and grown Australia&#8217;s post-pandemic economic recovery, which has been better than expected.</p>
<p>While a number of superannuation and retirement measures were announced, most of these are either changes or adjustments to existing measures.</p>
<p>It’s important to remember that the budget measures outlined need to be legislated before they come into effect. The same applies to the package of super measures announced in last year’s mid-pandemic October budget which remain in Parliament and are still subject to debate.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>SNAPSHOT OF CHANGES</strong></h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Higher withdrawal limit for First Home Super Saver Scheme </strong></li>
<li><strong>Removal of super contribution “work test” for those aged between 67 and 74</strong></li>

<p>In a change to an existing measure, the maximum withdrawal threshold for the existing First Home Super Saver Scheme will be increased to $50,000, from $30,000. This scheme does not allow first home buyers to withdraw any of their compulsory super savings, only voluntary savings qualify for release.</p>
<p>The budget will also abolish the work test, which requires those aged between 67 and 74 to be gainfully employed for at least 40 hours over 30 consecutive days during the financial year before concessional or non-concessional superannuation contributions can be made.</p>
<p>In another change to an existing measure, retirees who downsize their family home will be able to contribute $300,000 to superannuation ($600,000 for couples) at age 60, down from 65.</p>
<p>The government will remove the $450 minimum monthly income threshold, which prevents many low paid women, in particular, from receiving compulsory super contributions.</p>
<p>Further information to some of the measures below can be found in the <a href="https://budget.gov.au/2021-22/content/factsheets/index.htm">Treasury budget fact sheets</a>.</p>
<h4></h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>New threshold for First Home Super Saver Scheme </strong></h5>
<p>The Government proposes to increase to $50,000 the maximum amount of voluntary contributions aspiring home buyers can take from the First Home Super Saver Scheme.</p>
<p>This scheme allows people to make voluntary contributions to superannuation to save for their first home. At present these contributions are capped at $15,000 a year and $30,000 in total.</p>
<p>Under the proposed changes, contributions into a super fund will be allowed by salary sacrifice up to a maximum of $50,000 in total. Where there is a couple involved, both individuals will be able to utilise their caps up to a maximum of $100,000.</p>
<p>This scheme relates to voluntary contributions only. First home buyers cannot withdraw any part of their compulsory super savings – that is, super contributions made on their behalf by their employer &#8211; under the scheme.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed start date</strong>: 1 July 2022</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Work test abolished for those aged between 67 and 74 years </strong></h5>
<p>The budget will also abolish the work test, which requires those aged between 67 and 74 to be gainfully employed for at least 40 hours over 30 consecutive days during the financial year before concessional or non-concessional superannuation contributions can be made.</p>
<p>This will allow individuals aged 67 to 74 years (inclusive) to make or receive non-concessional (including under the bring-forward rule) or salary sacrifice superannuation contributions without meeting the work test, subject to existing contribution caps. Individuals aged 67 to 74 years will still have to meet the work test to make personal deductible contributions.</p>
<p>The existing $1.6 million cap on lifetime superannuation contributions will continue to apply (increasing to $1.7 million from 1 July 2021). The annual concessional and non-concessional caps will also continue to apply.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed start date :1 July 2022</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>New age threshold for downsizers </strong></h5>
<p>In another change to an existing measure, retirees who downsize their family home will be able to contribute $300,000 to superannuation ($600,000 for couples) at age 60, down from 65. This contribution is classified as a  non-concessional (post-tax) contribution and is allowed in addition to existing super rules and caps including the total super balance cap of $1.6 million (to rise to $1.7 million on 1 July) . The measure is exempt from the work test however, but it is not exempt from the $1.6 million (also rising to $1.7 million on 1 July) transfer balance cap (which limits the amount of money you can put into a pension phase account where the earnings are tax free).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed start date</strong>: 1 July 2022</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Removal of $450 monthly income threshold </strong></h5>
<p>The $450 monthly threshold prevents an estimated 300,000 low paid workers, 63% of whom are female, from receiving mandatory employer super contributions. The removal of this threshold will ensure this cohort of workers are paid super.</p>
<p><strong>Proposed start date</strong>: 1 July 2022</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Transfer of superannuation to the KiwiSaver Scheme</strong></h5>
<p>The Government will provide $11.0 million over four years from 2021-22 (and $1.0 million per year ongoing) to the Australian Taxation Office to administer the transfer of unclaimed superannuation money directly to KiwiSaver accounts (the New Zealand equivalent of Australian superannuation funds).</p>
<p><strong>Proposed start date</strong>: 1 July 2021</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Legacy product conversions</strong></h5>
<p>A two-year period will be provided for conversion of market-linked, life-expectancy and lifetime pension and annuity products. Importantly, it will not be compulsory for individuals to take part.</p>
<p>Retirees with these products who choose to will be able completely exit these products by fully commuting the product and transferring the underlying capital, including any reserves, back into a superannuation fund account in the accumulation phase. From there they can decide to commence a new retirement product, take a lump sum benefit, or retain the funds in that account.</p>
<p>Any commuted reserves will not be counted towards an individual’s concessional contribution cap and will not trigger excess contributions. Instead, they will be taxed as an assessable contribution of the fund (with a 15 per cent tax rate), recognising the prior concessional tax treatment received when the reserve was accumulated and held to pay a pension.</p>
<p>Products covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Market-linked, life-expectancy and lifetime products which were first commenced prior to 20 September 2007 from any provider, including self-managed superannuation funds (SMSFs).</li>
</ul>
<p>Products NOT covered</p>
<ul>
<li>Flexi-pension products offered by any provider, and lifetime products offered by a large APRA-regulated defined benefit schemes or public sector defined benefit schemes, will not be included.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Proposed start date</strong>: 1 July 2022</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h5><strong>Pension Loans Scheme</strong></h5>
<p>The flexibility of the Pension Loans Scheme is being improved by providing access to advance payments through allowing participants to access up to 26 fortnights’ worth of top-up payments as a lump sum and introducing a No Negative Equity Guarantee. The will provide immediate access to lump sums of around $12,000 for singles, and $18,000 for couples.</p>
<p>No Negative Equity Guarantee will mean that borrowers under the PLS, or their estate, will not owe more than the market value of their property, in the rare circumstances where their accrued PLS debt exceeds their property value. This brings the PLS in line with private sector reverse mortgages</p>
<p><strong>Proposed start date</strong>: 1 July 2022</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><strong>Previous Budget measures scheduled to come into effect on 1 July 2021 </strong></h4>
<p>The Your Future Your Super measures proposed in last October’s budget – which include a measure that will staple everyone to their current superannuation fund and apply performance testing to many funds &#8211;  are scheduled to come into effect on 1 July. However, as the legislation is still before Parliament,  the final scope of the proposed reforms and their implementation date is not yet known.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When retirement is years away, it can be hard to see how one lonely number on your annual statement equates to your whole lifestyle in retirement.</p>
<p>And while the Association of Super Funds of Australia (ASFA) publishes figures each quarter showing what your <em>final </em>super balance needs to be when you retire to live a ‘comfortable’ lifestyle, how do you know how you are <em>actually</em> tracking against achieving that figure (or whatever final figure you are aiming for)?</p>
<p>Luckily, finding out if you’re on track is easy!</p>
<p>Simply type your year of birth into the <a href="http://www.superguru.com.au/calculators/super-detective">Super Balance Detective Calculator</a> and see what your super balance should be today to reach a ‘comfortable’ retirement at age 67 (according to the <a href="https://www.superannuation.asn.au/resources/retirement-standard">ASFA quarterly Retirement Standards</a> figures).</p>
<p>We’ve picked a few sample years below to show you.</p>
<table>
<tbody>

<td width="301">
<h5 style="text-align: center;">Year of birth/age</h5>

<p>Please the <a href="http://www.superguru.com.au/calculators/super-detective">Super Balance Detective Calculator</a> page for the assumptions used to calculate these amounts.</p>
<h4></h4>
<h4><strong>What</strong><strong> if you’re behind?</strong></h4>
<p>It’s never too late! The great news is that even small amounts contributed to your super now will boost your retirement balance.</p>
<p>Of course, the younger you start, the longer your money has to compound and grow but even if you are only a few years away from retirement, you could make a difference to your final balance by acting now.</p>
<h4><strong>What can you do?</strong></h4>
<p>There are quite a few options to help grow your super. You could consider:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238876_ElectricSuper-Request-to-vary-reg-conts_V2.pdf">salary sacrifice</a></li>
<li>making <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/08/247130-ElectricSuper-Lump-Sum-Contributions-Form-Aug-2020_v1.pdf">personal tax-deductible contributions</a></li>
<li>making <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238876_ElectricSuper-Request-to-vary-reg-conts_V2.pdf">after-tax contributions</a></li>
<li>your spouse can <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238877_ETSAC_Contributions-Splitting-App_V4.pdf">share contributions</a> with you from their super.</li>
</ul>
<p>On top of that, you can make sure you are well educated about your super and what it’s doing</p>
<ul>
<li>look at the <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/investments/">investment option</a> your super is in. Is it suitable for you and your aims? Try the online risk profiler to discover how much risk/return you can handle.</li>
<li>Check if you have any lost super. You may have account balances in other funds that are being eroded by fees. Log into the <a href="https://secure.superfacts.com/customer/EISS/login?client_id=TsikUeoWS7G3pLxp2UAzQ3cyX8sRUaUg&amp;redirect_uri=https://www.youraccountonline.com/form/login.html&amp;scope=customers:website&amp;state=S1NiZU96dXBXN0dkV1Y0MS1FSVNT&amp;code_challenge=mGxgYiJmncWjrzt3qkUPGy4Zr4XxF5BO1GUZf4grncE&amp;code_challenge_method=S256&amp;client_type=web">member portal</a> to view your other super accounts, or go directly to <a href="https://my.gov.au">my.Gov.au</a> to get started.</li>
</ul>
<h4><strong>Other helpful steps you can try</strong></h4>
<p>While being on track is a good feeling, it’s nice to know <strong><em>what</em></strong> you’re on track for. The <a href="https://www.superannuation.asn.au/resources/retirement-standard">ASFA Retirement Standard</a> shows you what retirement super balance you would need for a ‘comfortable’ retirement.</p>
<p>You can also try the <a href="https://supercalcs.com.au/ris9/mst">Retirement Planner online tool</a>. It will let you see what your final retirement balance will be if things continue as they are now, using your age, income, current balance and more. You can then play with the numbers and see what a difference extra contributions or retiring later could make.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you’re dealing with the ups and downs of your new family, the first words, the first steps, the first day at school, the last thing you want to be thinking about is super.</p>
<p>But it could be a great time to consider your financial future together and the baby steps you could take to make sure it’s all you want it to be.</p>
<p>If you or your partner are pressing pause on the 9-5, the amount the stay-at-home parent receives to their super is likely to be significantly lower. It could (obviously) be as low as zero. Once you deduct ongoing fees and insurance premiums, their super could actually start to go backwards.</p>
<p>It doesn’t have to be that way, though. There are steps you can take to help ensure that your (or your partner’s) super isn’t derailed by the pitter patter of tiny feet.</p>
<p><strong><img loading="lazy" class=" wp-image-4614 alignleft" src="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Add-a-heading-1-300x169.png" alt="" width="437" height="246" srcset="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Add-a-heading-1-300x169.png 300w, https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Add-a-heading-1-1024x576.png 1024w, https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Add-a-heading-1-768x432.png 768w, https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Add-a-heading-1-1536x864.png 1536w, https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Add-a-heading-1.png 1600w" sizes="(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px" />What difference can taking a couple of years away from work really make?</strong></p>
<p>Let’s have a look at some numbers.</p>
<p>Let’s assume you’re both currently 30 years old, on the same $80,000 salary with the same $100,000 current super balance and your first child arrives when you’re 32, with a second child when you’re 35. Assuming one partner takes a full year off work with the arrival of each child and works part time (let’s assume 0.5 FTE) until the youngest starts school, your combined super balance between both of you at age 60 will be more than $93,000 lower at retirement than it would have been if both of you had continued to work full time right through.*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Start at work</strong></p>
<p>Some employers offer financial support to their employees while they take time away for things such as the arrival of a child. It could be a regular salary amount for a certain number of weeks or a once-off bonus payment.</p>
<p>In some cases, the employers’ support will include payments into super. Check with your employer (or have your partner check with their employer) to find out what they offer to help support you and your new family.</p>
<p><strong>Then see what’s offered by the government</strong></p>
<p>The Australian Government offers Parental Leave Pay for up to 18 weeks, subject to certain conditions. You can find out more at <a href="http://www.servicesaustralia.gov.au/individuals/services/centrelink/parental-leave-pay">Services Australia</a>.</p>
<p>The payments don’t include superannuation, but you or your spouse could put money into super with some of this money you receive from the government.</p>
<p><strong>Look at your household’s super</strong></p>
<p>On top of this, there are options available in super to help make sure that the superannuation of both people in your household is as well-balanced and robust as possible. Let’s have a look at some of them:</p>
<p><strong>An ElectricSuper Spouse Account</strong></p>
<p>If your partner doesn’t have an ElectricSuper account, you can nominate for them to open one. As a <a href="http://www.electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Spouse_Membership_Application_Form.pdf">Spouse Member</a>, they will enjoy the same benefits you do, such as paying no admin fees, a choice of 4 great investment options and the opportunity to apply for Death and TPD insurance at competitive rates.</p>
<p>They could then investigate rolling their other super into the new ElectricSuper Spouse Account to reduce fees they are paying to other funds. Of course, as with anyone rolling money from one super account to another, your spouse will need to consider if rolling out of their other fund(s) is right for them which includes thinking about what benefits (such as insurance) they would lose by closing the other account.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://www.electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2021/05/Spouse_Membership_Application_Form.pdf">ElectricSuper Spouse Account</a> isn’t only a great option for paying no admin fees while your spouse is away from work. When your partner returns to work, they can give their employer the Standard Choice form and ask for their super contributions to be paid into ElectricSuper. Their account will then grow with regular contributions each pay day.</p>
<p><strong>Contribution splitting</strong></p>
<p>Another option available is that any ElectricSuper member can split some super into their spouse’s super account – whichever super fund that account is with.</p>
<p>You can split up to 85% of your pre-tax contributions to your spouse’s account. Pre-tax contributions are the contributions you receive from your employer (that is, the super guarantee payments they make for you) and any salary sacrifice contributions you make.</p>
<p>There is no cost to split contributions to your spouse’s existing super account (either with ElectricSuper or with another fund). While they’re away from work, it could be a great way to keep their super account active and growing.</p>
<p>See the form to read more about what’s required to <a href="http://www.electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/01/238877_ETSAC_Contributions-Splitting-App_V4.pdf">split your super to your spouse online</a> here</p>
<p><strong>And while we’re talking about sharing…</strong></p>
<p>You or your partner could also think about making contributions to the super account of the stay-at-home spouse with after-tax money too. No formal arrangement is required.</p>
<p>There is sometimes reluctance to share super between spouses. After all, each of you has worked for your own super and the account is in your name alone. We respect that. However, if you feel reluctant to share your super, remember that super is treated like any other asset in a relationship in the case of a relationship breakdown.</p>
<p>If things do go sour, your super and your partner’s super will all be considered as an asset of the relationship to be shared out, just like the house, car and the vintage Nirvana vinyl LP collection.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Super runs on a basic principle: money goes in and, when you reach a condition of release such as retirement, money comes out.</p>
<p>A lump sum of money at retirement is a very exciting prospect. But what will you do with your final balance when you can access it?</p>
<p>The options are literally endless. From no-interest security nightmares like tucking it under the mattress, to putting it in a low-interest bank account, to a term deposit, to choosing to invest in shares, property, diamonds or space rockets, the sky is the limit.</p>
<p>However, all of those options carry financial risks, from your money losing value as it falls behind inflation under the mattress, to choosing poor performing shares or your money being lost in a failed space rocket venture (and everything in between). Without education and experience, it can be a risky game to manage your own life savings.</p>
<p>That’s where getting an income stream could help you. You can put your money with the super industry professionals you’ve trusted for years by investing some or all of your super money into an income stream (also known as an allocated pension). An ElectricSuper Income Stream is available to retiring ElectricSuper members and their spouses.</p>
<p>It’s a way to invest your money and have it managed by professionals, while you have easy access to your money.</p>
<p><strong>What benefits does an Income Stream offer?</strong></p>
<p>An income stream stands out as a special kind of investment for those who have retired and reached their “preservation age” for the following reasons:</p>
<ul>
<li>it lets you keep your money in the superannuation system, which can give tax benefits</li>
<li>you can choose how you want your money invested (low risk/low return through to high risk/high return) without having to personally select investments</li>
<li>receive a regular income from your money, direct to your bank account – you choose how much and how often</li>
<li>access extra lump sum amounts whenever you need</li>
<li>nominate your spouse to continue receiving your regular income payments if you die (this can reduce stress on them as well as provide tax advantages)</li>
<li>online visibility of your account balance, your account’s performance and the ability to change payment amounts and payment periods online in a secure website</li>
<li>payments you receive are tax-free if you’re over 60</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>How do you get started?</strong></p>
<p>To <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/app/uploads/2020/03/238897_ElectricSuper-Benefit-Instructions_V9.pdf">open an ElectricSuper Income Stream</a>, you need to have at least $30,000 in your ElectricSuper super account. You don’t need to move all your super into the Income Stream (though you can if you wish). You can also add other money from other sources at the time you set up the account, such as from savings or other super accounts. Make sure that you have all your finances lined up when you are opening your account getting more money into super once retired can be tricky and there are rules that govern your ability to do this.</p>
<p>When you open an Income Stream account, you will need to nominate how much you would like to receive each year. You can choose any amount you like, as long as you take out at least the <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/retirement/income/retirement-income-stream/">minimum specified</a> by the government each year. You also choose how often you’d like to receive a payment. Choose from fortnightly, monthly, quarterly, twice a year or annual payments.</p>
<p>Whatever amount and payment frequency you choose, you can change it later in the secure section of the ElectricSuper website if you need to.</p>
<p>There is an administration fee for having an Income Stream. It’s 0.4% per year of your account balance, to a maximum of $800. It’s deducted from your account monthly.</p>
<p><strong>What happens after your account is set up?</strong></p>
<p>We will invest your Income Stream balance in line with your chosen <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/investments/options/">investment option</a> (or options). You can choose from Cash, Conservative Growth, Balanced Growth or High Growth (or a mix of them).</p>
<p>We will start making the regular payments you requested from your Income Stream account balance to your nominated bank account.</p>
<p>As you age, the minimum percentage you must take from your Income Stream will increase. You can see the minimum amounts on our website. We will contact you when your minimum percentage changes.</p>
<p>You can see your account balance in the online secure member area of the website. You will be able to monitor it increasing with positive investment returns and reducing with your regular payments, any lump sums you take, any negative investment returns and the administration fee.</p>
<p>In the online secure member area you can also change your payment frequency or amount at any time, as well as requesting lump sums from your account balance. You can also request these changes or lump sum payments using a form, available in the <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/resources/forms-publications/">Resources section</a> of our website.</p>
<p><strong>What’s next?</strong></p>
<p>If you think that an Income Stream could help support your lifestyle in retirement, <a href="https://electricsuper.com.au/meet-with-us/">make an appointment</a> to talk to our Member Services team. Even if you are years away from retirement, they can discuss the facts of an Income Stream with you and answer any questions about how it could work for you.</p>

										<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>From 1 July 2021, the transfer balance cap is changing. That means the amount you can move into a retirement product may change from $1.6 million to up to $1.7 million, depending on your circumstances.</p>
<p>It is different for everyone and the changes could make a significant difference for some members. We recommend you speak to your financial adviser to find out how or if this change impacts you.</p>
<table style="border-collapse: collapse; width: 100%;" border="1">
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="width: 50%;">
<h4>If you&#8217;ve never had a retirement phase income stream before:</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you start a retirement phase income stream for the first time on or after 1 July 2021, your personal transfer balance cap will increase from $1.6 million to $1.7 million.</p>
<p>If this is you, you are now permitted to transfer up to $1.7 million into retirement phase products, such as the Income Stream, when the time comes.</td>
<td style="width: 50%;">
<h4>If you had a retirement phase income stream before 1 July 2021</h4>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li>If the balance of your retirement phase income stream was $1.6 million or more at any time between 1 July 2017 and 30 June 2021, your transfer balance cap remains at $1.6 million.</li>
<li>In all other cases, your transfer balance cap will be between $1.6 million and $1.7 million, linked to the highest ever balance of that account.</li>
</ul>
</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<h4><strong>Changes to other concessional caps</strong></h4>
<p>There are also changes to the caps (or limits) on some other types of contributions for people whose super balance is $1.7 million or more at 30 June 2021:</p>
<ol>
<li>you will not be eligible for ‘bring forward’ arrangements</li>
<li>you will have a non-concessional contribution cap of zero</li>
<li>you will not be entitled to a Government co-contribution</li>
</ol>
<p>Also, you will not be able to claim the tax offset for superannuation contributions made on behalf of a spouse or claim a deduction for contributions made on behalf of your spouse if your spouse’s super balance is more than $1.7 million on 30 June 2021.</p>
<p>The ATO website has all the details on how you can see your highest account balance and where you can find out if your personal transfer balance cap will be raised above $1.6 million. You can also find information about the concessional and non-concessional caps there.</p>
